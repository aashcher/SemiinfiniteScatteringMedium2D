%% description:
% Fourier matrix of the permittivity and the inverse permittivity of a
% 1D binary grating
%% input:
% no - number of Fourier harmonics
% alps: relative widths of the grating period elements (should meet the conditions
%   0 < alps(i) < 1 and sum(alps) == 1)
% poss: relative positions of the centers of the grating period elements
%   (should not overlap)
% eps: permittivities of the grating period elements
%% output:
% FE: Fourier matrix of size (2*no-1,2), which contains
% Fourier components of the permittivity (FE(:,1)) and the inverse
% permittivity (FE(:,2))
%% implementation
