The code calculates 2D scattering of a polarized electromangetic wave by a
semi-infinite structure, which is represented either as a set of random
cylinders or a Voronoi diagram with each cell having some prescribed
dielectric permittivity.

The supercell approach is used, which means that the medium is simulated as
being periodic in the horizontal X direction. A numerical limit for reflection
characteristics for increasing period can be calculated. Enseble averaged
power reflection can be calculated.

The periodic problem is solved by the Fourier Modal Method. For this pupose
a given realization of scattering structure (a sufficiently thick layer 
-H < z < 0 filled with inclusions of different permittivities) is divided 
into a set of plane slices, which thickness dh is small comparable to the
wavelength, and the spatial permittivity distribution in each slice is
represented as a piecewise-constant function of the coordinate X in a
period. FMM is used to find the S-matrix of each slice and the S-matrix
algorithm is used to calculate an S-matrix of a layer of N_s slices.
Convergence of the power reflection in the dependence of N_s can be traced.

In case of random cylinders to generate a structure a thick period is
divided into square 'cells', each cell can either contain a cylinder of
random radius or be empty. This is an example and any other structure 
generation algorithm preserving the periodicity can be used.

In case of Voronoi structure

For reliable simulations the number of Fourier harmonics used in the FMM
should be at least about four time larger than the period-to-wavelength
ratio.
